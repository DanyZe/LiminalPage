# Commit and push after changes

After making code changes in this project:

1. **Stage** the modified files: `git add <files>` (or `git add -A` for all changes).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message: `git commit -m "brief description"`.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push`.

Do this at the end of the session when changes are complete, unless the user explicitly says not to commit, not to push, or to leave changes uncommitted.

Use PowerShell-compatible commands (no `&&`; use `;` to chain).
